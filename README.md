# Tailwind CSS `justify-between` Overflow Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS's `justify-between` utility. When one flex item is significantly wider than others, it can cause unexpected layout issues, potentially overflowing its parent container.

## Bug Description

The primary issue lies in how `justify-between` distributes space. It only works effectively when all flex items have relatively similar widths. If one item is much larger, it can push the other items out of their intended positions, resulting in content that extends beyond the boundaries of the container.

## Solution

Several solutions exist to address this.  The best approach depends on your specific layout requirements:

* **Set a fixed width:** Assign a maximum width to the container or the wider flex item.
* **Use `flex-shrink`:** Allow the wider item to shrink to accommodate available space.
* **Alternative layout:** Consider using alternative layout options like `flex-wrap` or a different flex-direction.
